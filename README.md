# time-database

outside time-owner folder, you need to do "npm i express mongoose cors"

go into time-owner folder "cd time-owner", to do "npm i react-router-dom axios"

I think you also need to do "npm install"

When you want to run the code, you need to go into task-database/time-owner/time-owner/time-owner folder, type command "npm start"

In the task-database/time-owner/time-owner folder, you also need to use "CMD" or Click the right mouse button and select Git Base Here, to type"nodemon server.js"
